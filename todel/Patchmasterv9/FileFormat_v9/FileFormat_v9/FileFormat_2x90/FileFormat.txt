                                          PatchMaster v2.74, 30-Sep-2014
(************************************************************************PatchMaster generates multiple files when you create a data file. They can be combined into a "bundle" file, if requested. The bundle file formatis described in the document "DataFile_v9.txt".The files are:   1. The data file itself (file with file extension ".dat").       This raw data file is a continuous data stream.   2. The "pul" file, containing acquisition parameters, such as gain,      capacitance, etc. The pointer to the data stored in the raw data      file is also stored in this file.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.   3. The "pgf" file, containing the stimulus templates.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.   5. The "sol" file containing the solution data base.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.   6. The "onl" file containing the stored online analysis methods.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.   7. The "mth" file containing the applied acquisition methods.      The format is described in the file "MethodFile_v9.txt".   8. The "mrk" file containing the markers.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.   9. The optional "amp" file, when a multiple amplifier is used.      It contains the multiple amplifier settings and solutions.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.  10. The optional "ana" file with the analysis results created by      FitMaster.      The information is stored in the "Tree" format described below.The descriptions of the variables, their names and meanings, and their respective record offsets are described in the following files:	AmplTreeFile_v9.txt	DataFile_v9.txt	DataFormat_v9.doc	FileFormat.txt	MarkerFile_v9.txt	MethodFile_v9.txt	Online_v9.txt	PulsedFile_v9.txt	SolutionsFile_v9.txt	StimFile_v9.txt	TimeFormat.txt
The following is a description of the "Tree" format. Following the description of the "Tree" format a source code listing is enclosed. That program shows how to scan and load a "Tree" file. It can be compiled and executed by the PowerMod environment. The source code is commented and can easily be translated to other languages.The idea behind the "Tree" format is that it allows extending the information stored in a file without braking the older file format. Thus, newer program versions can load files created by older program versions and vice versa without requiring any file conversions. This approach is presently (in 1995) working since more than 10 years across many program versions.An example tree can be diagrammed as follows:    Level 0 Record (Root)       Level 1 Record 1          Level 2 Record 1.1             Level 3 Record 1.1.1             Level 3 Record 1.1.2          Level 2 Record 1.2       Level 1 Record 2          Level 2 Record 2.1             Level 3 Record 2.1.1          Level 2 Record 2.2             Level 3 Record 2.2.1             Level 3 Record 2.2.2             Level 3 Record 2.2.3             Level 3 Record 2.2.4       Level 1 Record 3There is only ever one record of level 0, the root record.  The abovetree has four levels, the root (level 0), levels 1 and 2, and the leafnodes (level 3).The format of a tree stored to a file is as follows:    1) Magic number : 054726565H    2) Number of levels    3) Level sizes, one per level    4) Tree records, top down, left-to-right.  Each record has the format:       A) Record contents       B) Number of childrenAll of the values (except the record contents) are INT32 values, i.e., 32-bit (4 bytes) values.The "Tree" format is based on proposals from Stefan Heinemann, Erwin Neher, and Walter Stuehmer.WARNING: Never assume you know the record sizes. The record sizes may          have changed, e.g., because the file has been created by an          older program version which used fewer fields than it is          currently using. You MUST use the record sizes stored in the          files themselves, otherwise you are asking for BIG troubles!The trace data are stored in the data file as follows:   first trace    -> at offset "Data"    -> having "DataPoints" samples    -> to be scaled with "DataFactor1"    leak trace, if "Leak" = TRUE    -> at offset (Data + 2*DataPoints)    -> having "DataPoints" samples    -> to be scaled with "DataFactor1"    second trace, if "SecondTrace" = TRUE    -> at offset:             (Data + 2*DataPoints), if no leak             (Data + 4*DataPoints), if leak present    -> having "DataPoints" samples    -> to be scaled with "DataFactor2" notes about stored trace data: - it is stored "Leak Subtracted" - but not "Zero Subtracted" - add the leak to get the "non subtracted" trace - subtract "ZeroCurrent" from the scaled trace to get the "Zero Subtracted" trace notes about the second trace: - stored without "Leak Subtraction" - stored without "Zero Subtraction" ************************************************************************)MODULE FileFormat;FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADR, ADDRESS, BYTE, LONG, SHORT;FROM SYSTEMp1 IMPORT INT32, ADDADR;IMPORT Alert, FileSelect, IOBytes, IOFiles, Strings, TermIO, Buffer;(* * MagicNumber - This is a special value used as a prefix for a tree  * stored to a file.
